I am currently living with a roommate who has just moved out of her mother's house, she has no job and her mother sends her utility and rent money. Her only responsibility is to send her mom the rent bill, and she sends half of that or pays half to the company. The problem is that this girl is SO lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and I'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. I have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. To top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother REFUSES to answer my phone calls or emails.

I'm really not sure how to do this, I've been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.

My husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the ""world"" to get him in the door. This hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. He's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.

I applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.

Anyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.

We are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I'd have to use the library in town.

I'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don't deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.

I want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don't get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I'd find a way to get them food before letting that happen. I'll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on Tuesday.

First off - I will **not** *starve* between now and Friday, so if you'd rather help someone who has absolutely nothing, I understand, appreciate your stance, and thank you for helping someone truly in need.  

I've been unemployed for better than two years. During that time, I watched most of my photography clients (I did a lot of corporate work) shut down their budgets for expenditures like me. As that income dwindled, I began looking for other work. I'm not sure how much the year-long gap of ""employment"" (other than self-employed) has mattered, but I haven't been able to find anything. About a week and a half ago I finally got to the point I had to take a laborer job that's physically killing me (ok, it's only very painful). So I'll have something coming my way soon.  

In the mean time, I have a 1/2 sack of potatoes, a few cans of corn, 1/2 jar of peanut butter, 3/4 loaf of bread, and a few boxes of mac and cheese. All of which is pretty much what I've been eating for the past couple of weeks. Like I said, I won't starve, but I damn sure don't have a meal I'm actually looking forward to for the next week.  

It's just me. My dog passed the day after Easter, and as much as I'd love another pet, I know I'm not in a position financially to take on another right now. So even a medium pizza would be like 4 meals - I could take a couple of slices to work every other day for lunch or something just to break the monotony of what I've been having.  

I'm not hiding behind a new account - I am who I am. A quick look at my profile will tell you exactly who I am, and hopefully give you a sense that I try to contribute to the community as well when I can (/r/TOMT, /r/picrequest, gift exchanges, postcards to kids/random people/etc., general blathering). You'll also see where I've sold some of my camera gear to a fellow redditor because I needed the money. I feel bad asking when it's not a matter of ""need it or I'll die"", but I figure if I'm just honest about where I am, someone might throw me a ~~bone~~ pizza in the spirit of the *Random Acts* part of the subreddit.

I've made my way in to uni at 8:30pm to work on assignments and get ahead in general. I came straight from a netball game to here, so haven't eaten a thing since lunch.

To explain the title, I am absolutely and completely broke in terms of both spirit and cash. The year started off with my girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me and having to move out, which sunk me into a state of depression.

I was working full time, but had plans in place to go back to uni and leave my job. My annual leave payout was going to cover my credit card debts, and I was to rely on welfare + a part time job to cover rent, bills, petrol, etc. The annual leave payout was a lot less than I anticipated, as I was taxed a lot, meaning I could only pay off one credit card, and the rest paid my rent in advance for a couple of weeks to make sure there were no issues there. Centerlink have screwed me around, and have told me I may potentially be waiting six months before they start paying me. I've been looking, but struggling, to find part time work. I made $100 last week for fixing a family members computer, and I put in about 15 hours of work to earn that money, but haven't seen any more since. 

My car rego is now overdue, I have two months of unpaid phone bills that need to be paid, when I run out of petrol (I have about half a tank at the moment) I have no idea how I'm going to get to and from uni, and I have absolutely no idea where the money for my car payment and insurance is going to come from on Friday. Not to mention the required payments for my other two credit cards, which I'm now starting to get payment reminders for.

The reason I'm struggling with uni is that because of the depression, I'm also suffering from anxiety, and it has been a real struggle to get myself to uni. I've been stressing about where the money is going to come from to cover all my bills, and what I'm going to do when I need to start making rent payments again. Not to mention being out dealing with centerlink and desperately looking for work.

Please help a fellow redditor in need out and sort me out with a pizza to help me get through the night. When a source of income comes in, I am more than happy to return the favour. When I do have money, I try to regularly made it a habit to help people out. I'm also happy to fulfil requests, but bear in mind that I'm at uni.

Thanks in advance =)

I don't think anything like this has been done here before (long term lurker) so hopefully I get some points for at least being original. Yes this is a request and yes I will paint my walls any one color that my generous offer-er requests. I'm **not** starving, trying to feed 10 people, telling a made up sob story, or crying over having ugly walls. Still with me? Ok. Lets have some fun with this!

I have linked some pictures below, so that you see what you have to work with. The walls are an off white/egg color (bleh). Have you ever gone to someone's house and thought ""Wow, why did they pick this stupid color?"" I am regretting my decision of selecting this color. Just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. Maybe I just have dirty fingers? :D

I hope I can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. I'm not a good designer by any means. I still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. No wonder I'm single. 

Anyway, I want to thank you for reading my very long post. I hope you enjoy your Saturday and won't spend the day watching paint dry. Please pick a good color. Any color other than white/egg shell. Please and thank you :)

Right now I have no gas, and that in itself is nothing new.  But I also have no food, or cash.  I'm not really a fan of spilling my life story.

I ended up becoming her carer and after about five years of constantly hiding anything sharp or pill related and just generally taking care of her, I kind of snapped (or broke. However you want to put it).  It's now eleven years later and the depression pretty much controls my life.  
I do get enough money to pay most of my bills.  Though gas and shopping are the lowest priorities.  I have gas/electric here, so thankfully the gas doesn't heat the water for the shower.  
I'm not the type of person that can put off paying the bills in order to buy groceries.  Even though sometimes I really should.  That's just the way I was raised.  Sucky, yes, but at least I have the internet and tv to keep me from going insane.

t3_lmy9r,2,7,"Hey RAoP

This is a throwaway account but I'd be happy to PM you from my real account as verification. I've given before and never received.

First up I'd like to say that pizza is NOT necessary and we won't starve without it. Not even a bit. We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. 

I'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)

Add that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P
We literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling. 

What would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days. 

I might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P

This all adds up to another 300+ dollars and I just had to pay rent which was another 450+ dollars.

He was in a coma for the first couple of days, then he came out but the doctors had to put him back into one (Self induced coma) in order to maintain his levels of stability for surgery. He is still in critical condition and I am hosting a benefit concert with my band for his family. They lost their mother when they were young (Elementary school) and Ethan (The boy who was hurt) has a twin brother. I've known them almost all of my life and am putting this concert together almost single handedly. 

I'm hoping to give pizza to the folks that are working at the concert and the bands playing.
If I get enough, I'll even sell it for just $1 a slice at the concert for extra benefit money for his family! 

Here is the link to the concert information for those of you wanting to just send your support.- https://www.facebook.com/events/164208037116711/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular

The pizza place (Shaker's) does not deliver so I will have to pick it up. You can order it for September the 28th from 1pm-6pm. You can possibly even preorder it! But if you do decide to order, order it under the name of ""Steeple"". That's how I'll pick it up. Thank you so much for those of you who send support and those who order! It means a lot. I've been so busy with this concert. 

The pizza place's number is (731)-663-2700.

EDIT: Also, please let me know if you order and for what time.

t3_lkdh6,1,2,"I can't believe I never found Reddit before today, I've been wasting my life on 4chan -_- Things are a lot more awesome here.

So I heard you can request pizza here, well I just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so I'm good. I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.

I lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.

He's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.

He's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.

Anyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?

I don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life. I can't ever repay him for all of it, just some of it, and this is how I wanna start.",0.09881944444444445,776.5553125,False,1,0,1319231962.0,1,0

My mother was not okay with it. According to her now, i am disowned from the family, and can no longer speak to her, unless i say i am deciding to not transition.

My dad's reaction was so misinformed that i inadvertently lost my cool trying to explain it, where i was then met with a stern 'Get out until you figure out that you're not a tra*ny'. 

My Mormon Grandad however, was not hostile, was not disagreeing, but merely said, ""Whilst i do not understand it, i'm sure you can help me find out."" He accepts what i'm doing and will not hold it against me, and will not treat me differently until i ask.

I'd love to have a roommate or boyfriend for that matter that doesn't stress me out and put so much pressure on me when it comes to money.

They've been unemployed since February and June, and I've been paying for everything for months. I really can't take it anymore. I can't even put away enough money to take a trip to get away from everything and everyone. Between work and school, I am really at my limit.

I'm hoping that another redditor who has been here before in this situation will help me with something other than canned vegetables for dinner (pretty please? :D).

It's Saturday, I have a little over $5 in my bank account, nothing but roommate chow at the apartment, a flat tire on my bike, and it's so windy and dusty out that the sky is pretty brown right now. 

By trade, I am a freelance writer. Sometimes it pays fabulously, the last few months not so much. But I understand the give-and-take of economy and I'd much rather put something together for you than accept charity. So I'm thinking a page of whatever you want for a medium pizza. Haiku about Thundercats, a love poem for your girlfriend to smooth over the fact that you got really drunk last night, I can get you started on that paper you're putting off, or just the word butt as many times as I can fit on the page. And none of that copy-paste bull crap either, I promise to type each one of those butts individually and by hand.

Maybe you want more than one page. These things happen. And I happen to be able to put away far more pizza than is probably healthy for me. Or I might want mushrooms AND pepperoni. We can work it out.

Just about the only thing I won't write is a signed confession that I was the one who committed that murder the cops are getting closer to solving. Let them figure it out on their own.

If you order a pizza for me, I promise to not only write for you, but will also enjoy said pizza ravenously while playing the video game of your choice, assuming I have it in my collection (odds estimated at 1 in 15). Can provide photo proof of brown sky, flat tire on bike, or other reasonable requests if needed. Will gladly provide gratuitous photo proof of pizza enjoyment if desired.

I had surgery three months ago to reconstruct my acl and meniscus.

We do have insurance to pay much of the bills for which I am thankful, but the bills we have had to pay have wiped us out and put us in debt.

I've never asked for assistance before and feel slightly unworthy when there are people with no food in their pantry out there. Still, if anyone can spare us a pizza tonight we'd be very grateful.

* At work so busy all day, No time to eat gotta run can't stay! 

* On my way home tummy starts to grumble, as my engine starts to putter and rumble.

* Oh no I need gas I say to myself. Have to reach for the pizza money up on the top shelf. 

* Not rich, nor poor. I walked into the house like every man through the front door. 

* I sit and look at whats on my desk, load up a bowl and take a deep breath. 

* After a hit I see in the corner a fresh new wrapped game.. Maybe a gift for a foreigner!!!!

* I log onto reddit and draw up a post, I decided a contest is what I should host.

* RandomActsOfGaming is where it has been layed. For 36 hours is where it will have stayed.

* Post completed happy with myself, A pizza is what I want I look to my shelf.

* Oh that's right I spent it on gas, and the rest of my money has to last.

* Oh well no worries what can you do, should not have got the extra super jumbo sized corn dog thing while high at the zoo. So random acts of pizza I turn to you

* I am not down on my luck or feeling blue. Others deserve it more then me this is true. 

* But if you find it in your heart to warm mine up tonight, I will surely do the same on first paychecks light.

Our cabinets/fridge are basically bare, other than spices and seasoning. We used up the last of our leftovers yesterday, and now we're down to bread, peanut butter, and water. And we've had a LOT of peanut butter, bread, and water lately. I hate to ask, but we literally don't even have a dollar until that money shows up.

If anyone wanted to send us a pizza or two, that'd be amazing. Signed up for a verification code just in case ;). We'd be more than willing to send you pizza(s) back when our transfer goes through, pay it forward to some other person here in need, or provide any variety of services as part of the agreement. Also, FWIW, we're in Bonner Springs, Kansas. Have Pizza Hut within delivery distance, and Dominos/Papa Johns within pick-up distance.

t3_zhzk6,0,1,"This is actually the long story short believe it or not, please excuse my terrible grammar its very late, and humans do not have an effective way of communicating how terrible a time my father and I are going through.

I was forced to move in with my father and his second wife, (then my stepmom) I had to withdraw from my college classes mid semester and quit my job. After living with my father who is schizophrenic bi-polar it became clear that he was extremely depressed by his living situation. He was being used by his wife for money, my father is the kind of person that when you ask something of him it is hard/next to impossible for him to say no. My father was paying rent, utilities, and iphones for 5 members of my stepmother's family. This literally used up 100% of my fathers money monthly. He would stay at home and do nothing but surf and web and read books, all the while my stepmother would use her disability money to buy shit we could not afford and routinely overspend and cause us to have overdraft fees that my father had no way to pay for, I've covered for her mistakes countless times, whenever she overspends she sells something of the family's to cover for her mistakes, the last thing she sold was the family kayak which was bought before they were married, all the while she still would use checks that were in her name to buy fancy furniture, and useless junk. To make matters worse, the stepmother has a son who SMOKES coke and w/e else he can get his hands on. This waste of life step brother of mine decided to get his GF pregnant who then popped out twins (they are religious and don't believe in abortion) The drug addict stepbrother is now a father of two kids when he cannot even support himself, he and his GF have been on welfare since the babies were born and neither have gotten a job or even tried to get their GEDs (yes they dropped out of high school) Now the stepmother spends most of her money on supporting the two kids and her fuck up son, she gives him cash to buy pot, cigs (which they smoke in a closed garage with the kids) I witnessed my stepbrother use his food stamps to buy only ice cream instead of getting real food for his kids and himself. At one point my father confided in me that he had considered suicide, this eneraged me and I decided I would do anything in my power to show my father that this leach of a stepmother cared nothing for him and was using him (he was in love with her and was in denial) I ended up getting evidence that my stepmother had pawned my father digital camera when she said that he had probably lost it. My father confronted her about it and she stood fast in her lie, my father then saw the light that this women was indeed using him and cared nothing for her. (in their 4 years of marriage they only had sex once and on their anniversary my father got her flowers, a card and wanted to take her to dinner but, she ended up going to see her fuck up son's kids instead.) The evidence of her using him continued to rise and rise for a few months until my father decided that he was going to tell her that he wanted a divorce. She ended up ripping out our internet and storming off to her mother's while texting my dad that she wanted the divorce too and that we were not to damage any of her property (oh the irony) or that she would make the divorce as hard as possible and take as much as she could. This was about a week ago and we have begun packing our stuff and preparing to move out, she has no intention of helping pay for the cancellation fees for the phones/net/tv ect. Together we have gotten enough money to pay for one more month so that we have time to move out and into my father's parent's house. Current between the two of us we have about 10$ until our next paychecks and have been eating at my father's parents. I have had to witness my father cry and think of ways to comfort him, he knows that this bitch doesn't really care for him and it is for the best that he gets the divorce but its all really overwhelming even for me, I can't imagine what it is like for a person with a disability such as his. I don't even know what to provide for proof but here is a hate email that my stepmother sent my father after he told her he wanted a divorce, its actually comic at some parts and really shows her true colors, some context though, I clean up after myself not my stepbrother and his two kids.

***YOU chose to allow your son to attack me and NEVER SAID HE WAS TO STOP!!!! A true husband protects his wife from everyone. Instead you sat there only saying I was to calm down. He is a spoiled brat because you never had him in your life. Where was he all those years until HE was going to be on the street. He disrespected your ex who you claim to care so much about. He has anger issues ANGER ISSUES. TEARING DOWN A DOOR God, what would he do to ME, someone he hates, if I didn't stand up to his lies. I fully intend to prove your precious camera, which, btw was purchased in your manic fit. We had all your fancy cameras as well as a perfectly good digital. Now, you make IT and that little devil separate us. I believe in Jesus Christ and AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, I WILL SERVE THE LORD. He believes in the internet..... PERIOD. I stopped feeling safe in my home when he attacked me the first time. He climbs on your lap makes me sick that you cannot see his making fun of you when he shakes your belly. He is a sick puppy. Everyone who has seen the ghostly boy says he is way strange the way he stays in his room all the time.

I told you the sex was what I got hurt doing. I never spoke up as to why, but when you dropped the dream of the surgery I knew you wanted to be diabetic and heavy all your life. I lost respect for you because even your family was encouraging you. For all I know anyway, maybe they weren't and you hid it from me. All I know is you don't ever want to go do anything and I am a very active person when I am having a good day from absence of pain. At least I see people when I go shopping and I recycle instead of buying expensive items we cannot pay for.

I have tried hard to keep a nice home for you and you have to be reminded to CLEAN CAT LITTER AND FEED. I can't do it all without feeling USED!

I raised my kids to help out...what happened to your Ryan, he is above lifting a finger. Does he even know how to clean his own (mostly his) bathroom. Cleaners are right on shelf and I have pretty towels that makes it nice and he chooses to disrespect and not use his towels instead. What disrespect.

I am not a happy person now or before I left there.

I hope you are happy that you allow your baby boy to separate us. YOU DID THIS.

My son WILL BE HELPING ME MOVE SO MAKE RYAN GO TO HIS MIKEY'S HOUSE WHEN WE ARE MOVING. My Son is angry for what unhappiness his Mother is under because of little boy Satan. Dustin told me two months ago that Ryan is pushing us to divorce. Pretty smart boy who adores his Mom. Dustin and Roy protect Me like you will not. ***

I'm behind on my mortgage, car and lights.

t3_1mzio9,12,27,"Hey Pizza People! First of all I just want to thank you guys for being so awesome and making this subreddit possible. Once I have money, I plan to be a random-pizza-giver :3

So backstory. Last year (I was 18), I was sexually assaulted by a stranger not too far from Harvard Square. It resulted in some severe PTSD: I couldn't sleep or eat. I was hardly able to function or focus enough to even engage in casual conversation. I couldn't stand to exist in my own mind any longer so I tried to fix it by drinking, which only made me feel sick and more depressed. I tried smoking weed (I'd smoked often before and it seemed to help then) but now the weed gave me flashbacks to the assault and made it so much worse. I was getting desperate. I don't know how the idea got into my head, but one morning I was getting dressed and I just made the decision. It was this voice of deliberate recklessness that announced, ""Today I'm going to try heroin.""

It was alarmingly easy to get my hands on it. It was cheap and it was everything I needed. I knew it was stupid, but I didn't care. I had nothing left to lose - and why stop when it works?

Well eventually I ended up in a psych hospital for the PTSD and heroin addiction. I got help, I got my shit together, and I'm going to college.

So yeah. That's my story. This is me [before and after](http://imgur.com/blBMtWH) getting my shit together.

Thanks for reading this, if you did :) otherwise,

This is my first post, and I'm not sure if I'm doin' this right (oh please correct me if I'm doing it wrong!) but here goes, here's why I wish I had a pizza right now (prepare for dramalama): 

**The worst:** I just had to tell this girl, the sweetest, funnest, cutest one you could ever imagine, that I didn't feel the same way about her that she did about me. Yes, I would sing her praises yet don't reciprocate, why? I've known her since we were kids, and since we've grown up, I absolutely can't see her as anything more than a little sister. She's never been quite lucky in love, and every fiber of my being knows she deserves more than a ""no"" from anyone, yet I can't be the one to do it -- I would be lying to myself and to her. Uggghhh, seeing her in this state, and knowing I caused it, is really taking it's toll on me. I've been dreaming about her, and even in my dreams I can't feel the same way, making me wake up only an hour or two into my sleep and unable to go back to sleep due to feeling so miserable. 

**The kind-of okay:** Aside from that, I simply don't have any food in the house right now, and my only ride out of this mountainous region isn't coming until (hopefully?) tomorrow, so that I may go get groceries. 

So, not having pizza in a long-ass time, I feel like one would definitely bring an umbrella to this raincloud party, as well as tie me over until my friend gets back up here. What say you, friend?",836.5989583333334,968.9148726851852,False,2870,2962,1374885667.0,2870,2962

I hate asking for charity. But it's been a rough couple of weeks. I have no money for the next couple of days, no way of earning more that quickly, and not much food bar some baked beans in the fridge.

On top of that, I'm ill. Not Beastie Boys ill, 'all my joints hurt and my hands won't stop shaking, I hate flu' ill. I should emphasise that I'm not starving, though.

You expect anything but good new, because you prep yourself for worst thing he could possibly say.  You brace yourself in defense of it, for weeks after they draw the blood from your veins.  It builds and builds up until that call.  And then it comes.  That intolerable small talk when the Doctor first gets on the line.
